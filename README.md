[jQuery-Tiles](https://hackyon.github.io/jQuery-Tiles/) - Image Tiling and Zooming
===================================================================

jQuery-Tiles is an image tiling and zooming library for really big images. It is a much simpler version of the tiling used in many mapping applications (such as Google Maps). As indicative in the name, this is a [jQuery](http://jquery.com) plugin.

Some features include:

* Lazy Loading - Tiled images are only loaded when they are viewable in the viewport, thereby reducing the time and bandwidth required when loading large images.
* Zoom and Drag - Support different levels of zooming for your tiled images, from thumbnail previews to high-resolution originals.
* Simple tiled image generation with the bash script ```generate.sh```.

Suggestions and contributions are encouraged.


Getting Started
--------------------------------------

### Generating the Tiled Images
The bash script, ```generate.sh``` simplifies the tile generation process. The script handles the tiling and directory structure of the generated tiles. 

1. Install [ImageMagick](http://www.imagemagick.org/script/binary-releases.php)
2. Move the source image, ```source.jpg``` to the same directory of ```generate.sh```
3. Run ```generate.sh``` with the desired zooms and tile size. For example, to generate 300x300 tiles at zooms 3 and 4, run ```./generate.sh -z '3 4' -t 300 source.jpg```
4. Tiled images will be generated under the ```tiles/``` directory

### Client-side JavaScript
To run jQuery-Tiles on a page, you need to include the [jQuery](http://jquery.com/) and [jQuery-UI](http://jqueryui.com/) dependencies:

```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.8.2/jquery.min.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="http://code.jquery.com/ui/1.9.0/jquery-ui.js"></script>

<script type="text/javascript" src="scripts/jquery.tiles.min.js"></script>
```

Simply select the viewport and initialize with options:

```javascript
$('.viewport').tiles({
  original: {
    width:  3264,                // Required - width of original image
    height: 2448,                // Required - height of original image
  },
  basePath: "images/pier/",      // Required - path containing the tiles/ directory
  loading: "images/loading.gif", // Optional - placeholder image for loading images
  zoom: 2                        // Optional - initial zoom level
});
```

Check out the source of the [demo](https://hackyon.github.io/jQuery-Tiles/) at ```docs/``` (see ```index.html```) for an example.


Build
--------------------------------------
The project is built with [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/).

1. Go to the project directory (containing grunt.js)
2. ```npm install```
3. ```grunt```

When you run grunt, the source code under ```src/``` will be linted, minified, and copied to ```jquery.tiles.js```, and ```jquery.tiles.min.js```, and the ```site/``` directory. You may want to run ```grunt watch``` before you edit the source so changes will be automatically copied and packaged.


Contributions
--------------------------------------
